H1N1, H3N2, and B mean the influenza virus subtypes (influenza virus H1N1, influenza virus H3N2, and influenza virus B subtypes). HIV+ subjects were stratified as immune responders and immune non-responders post-vaccination (“responders”≥ 4-fold increase of neutralization antibody at Day28/Day0; “non-responders” < 4-fold increase of neutralization antibody at Day28/Day0) to each influenza subtypes. RNA was isolated from the fresh isolated PBMCs on Day0 and Day7 in each responder and non-responder. So, the 0w means at day 0, 1w means at day 7.",
