Its aim is to improve the knowledge base of outcomes in adults with CHD. The registry design and baseline patient characteristics are reported. Methods: All patients with structural congenital heart defects or hereditary aortopathies, followed-up at dedicated adult CHD clinics, are asked to participate in SACHER. Data of participants are pseudonymised and collected in an electronic, web-based, database (secuTrial\u00ae). Collected data include detailed diagnosis, type of repair procedures, previous complications and adverse outcomes during follow-up. Results: From May 2014 to December 2016, 2836 patients (54% male, mean age 34 \u00b1 14 years), with a wide variety of congenital heart lesions, have been enrolled into SACHER. Most prevalent were valve lesions (25%), followed by shunt lesions (22%), cyanotic and other complex congenital heart disease (16%), diseases affecting the right heart, i.e., tetralogy of Fallot or Ebstein anomaly (15%), and diseases of the left ventricular outflow tract (13%); 337 patients (12%) had concomitant congenital syndromes. The majority had undergone previous repair procedures (71%), 47% of those had one or more reinterventions. Conclusion: SACHER collects multicentre data on adults with CHD. Its structure enables prospective data analysis to assess detailed, lesion-specific outcomes with the aim to finally improve long-term outcomes.",
