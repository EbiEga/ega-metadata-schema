			<!-- Within a submission XML, there is a diverse type of Actions (e.g. ADD, MODIFY, HOLD... take a look at https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/general-guide/programmatic.html#submission-xml) 
				 
				 Nevertheless, we will go through the 4 most common actions: ADD, MODIFY, VALIDATE and PROTECT. The three first can be repeated as many times as needed, and can be used alone or in combination with the others. These four will encompass most types of submissions:
				 	1. ADD:	Add an object to the archive.
					2. MODIFY:	Modify an object (previously submitted) in the archive.
					3. VALIDATE:	Validates the submitted XMLs without actually submitting them.
					4. PROTECT:	This action is required for data submitted to European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA), since the EGA deals with controlled access data.

				 Each <ACTION> can only be of one type (ADD, MODIFY...), and with the exception of <PROTECT>, the remaining three will exclusively refer to one single XML that you want to ADD, MODIFY or VALIDATE (i.e. one action is required for each XML or metadata object set).
