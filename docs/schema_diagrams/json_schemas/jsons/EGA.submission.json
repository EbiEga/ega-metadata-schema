Now, if in the future the term EFO:0000400 is changed in a new release of EFO, it's imperative to keep track of what version of EFO the submitter was referring to when it was referenced. Since most submitters would normally use the latest version of the ontologies at the time of the submission, these resources are intended to be automatically populated at every submission (and thus are not required) to ease the process; nonetheless, if provided, they should not be overwritten by that process.
