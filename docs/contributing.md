## Introduction
In this document you will find a brief description on **how to contribute to the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) metadata standards and how EGA handles contributions**. Metadata standards are permanently in change, and we want to cover our users needs above all. Although we thoroughly review bioinformatics' field standards to be in sync, there can be occasions in which there is room for improvement. Be it a new feature or different structure, **any suggestion is highly valued**.

Currently EGA does not support direct contributions (i.e. external Pull Requests) to our GitHub repository. 

If you need any help for your contribution, please contact ``helpdesk [at] ega-archive.org``.

## Suggesting changes
Before any suggestion or request is made, we advise you to check our metadata model through its [diagrams](./metadata_model/) and [JSON browser](./json_browser/). 

To make a suggestion you shall create an issue in this same GitHub repository, making use of the [**set of issue templates**](https://github.com/EbiEga/ega-metadata-schema/issues/new/choose
). In these templates you will find forms requesting information for us to consider your contribution based on its type: 
* **``new_cv_term``**: use this template to suggest new Controlled Vocabulary (CV) terms (e.g. addition of ``RNA-seq`` to the assay technology CV list).
* **``new_field``**: use this template to suggest new fields (e.g. addition of ``assay_technology`` to an experiment)

## Reporting bugs
To report any incorrect or unexpected result regarding our metadata standards, of any type (e.g. JSON schemas, documentation, issue templates...), please make use of the **``bug_report``** issue template that you will find in the [**set of issue templates**](https://github.com/EbiEga/ega-metadata-schema/issues/new/choose
). The form will guide you over the process of reporting a bug.

## Other suggestions
Please open blank issues for any other type of contributions, providing as many details as possible in a structured manner.
