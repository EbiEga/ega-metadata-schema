# Approximate release date of the dataset Schema

```txt
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EbiEga/ega-metadata-schema/main/schemas/EGA.dataset.json#/properties/approximateReleaseDate
```

An approximate date of the desired release of the dataset. Bare in mind that this will NOT automatically release the dataset, but instead may be used to set a reminder to the submitter (and EGA's HelpDesk team) in case the dataset was not released by this time. This would help in cases where this step was forgotten by the submitter or release was stalled for some reason.
