```

Comprises metadata (e.g. Source or Target) of a directional association between two entities. This relationships node contains all the possible relationships between metadata objects, both outside of (e.g. an Array Design Format that was submitted to ArrayExpress being linked to their microarray data within EGA) and within (e.g. an analysis being linked to a Sample) the EGA.
