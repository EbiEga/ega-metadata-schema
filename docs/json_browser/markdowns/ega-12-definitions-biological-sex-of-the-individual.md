An organismal quality inhering in a bearer by virtue of the bearer's physical expression of sexual characteristics. In other words, the trait that determines the individual's (from which the sample derives) reproductive function: mainly male or female. Term chosen from a list of controlled vocabulary (CV). If you cannot find your term in the CV list, please create an issue at our [metadata GitHub repository](https://github.com/EbiEga/ega-metadata-schema/issues/new/choose) proposing its addition.
