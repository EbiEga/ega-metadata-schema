```

Type of the dataset, expressing the overall purpose of the dataset. Term chosen from a list of controlled vocabulary (CV). If you cannot find your term in the CV list, please create an issue at our [metadata GitHub repository](https://github.com/EbiEga/ega-metadata-schema/issues/new/choose) proposing its addition. The CV was inherited from ENA's dataset types.
