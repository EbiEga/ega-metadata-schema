# Check that the object\_id's accession pattern and object\_type match Schema

```

This object exists with the only purpose of being a reference as a pattern check of a given object\_id and object\_type. The constraint consists in asserting that, if the object identifier is an EGA accession, its pattern matches the object type (e.g. if object\_type is 'sample', its EGA accession needs to match '^EGAN\[0-9]{11}$')
