Two washes were performed in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA. When using the commercial protocol with DIG-labeled probes, the membrane was hybridized and washed as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche DIG Easy Hyb 11 796 895 001). Membranes hybridized with radioactive probes were exposed 4 or 20 h on a phosphor screen before quantification. Membranes hybridized with non-radioactive probes were subsequently treated with an anti-DIG antibody"
