    "description": "Metadata schema used by the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) to validate its Study metadata object. This object is intended to contain metadata about the compilation of examinations, analyses or critical inspection of a particular subject. In other words, a Study is a container of experiments and analyses of any nature (including Array data) grouped by a common goal or investigation. They often draw together data from a range of datasets and are represented in publication. For instance, an example would be a case-control study on cancer patients and healthy individuals. Further details can be found in the EGA-metadata-schema GitHub repository (https://github.com/EbiEga/ega-metadata-schema/tree/main/schemas) and EGA-archive website (https://ega-archive.org/studies)",
