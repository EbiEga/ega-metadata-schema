# EGA Metadata Schema
## Overview
This repository is intended to be the **source of truth for EBI-EGA's metadata schemas**. For data to be submitted to the [EGA-archive](https://ega-archive.org/submission/quickguide), apart from the data files themselves (_e.g._ `. bam`), you will need an **appropriate metadata architecture** both describing your data and the underlying relationships between its objects (_e.g._ what experiments encompass which samples). 

Depending on the nature of your data (raw sequences, variant calling, arrays...) the metadata and its submission procedure will differ (_in progress_):
* [Array based metadata](https://ega-archive.org/submission/array_based/metadata): must be submitted using EGA submitter portal and completing the [Array-based format (AF) spreasheet](https://github.com/EbiEga/ega-metadata-schema/blob/8dca24c694b0c005f1b0d665f1c6900e766f38d7/templates/array-based-metadata/EGA_Array_based_Format_V4.3.xlsx) ([_direct download_](https://github.com/EbiEga/ega-metadata-schema/raw/8dca24c694b0c005f1b0d665f1c6900e766f38d7/templates/array-based-metadata/EGA_Array_based_Format_V4.3.xlsx)).
