# This workflow validates the current JSON documents against EGA's JSON schemas
# using EGA's API endpoint (http://biovalidator.ega.ebi.ac.uk/validate) of
# the tool Biovalidator (https://github.com/elixir-europe/biovalidator) and the
# up-to-date EGA JSON schemas (https://github.com/EbiEga/ega-metadata-schema/tree/main/schemas).
# The logic of this workflow is:
#   - Why: It allows us to know if the changes introduced in the branch are
#          compliant with the default (main branch) schemas.
#   - Would block the PR if failed? No, it's just informative.
#   - How: perform POST requests to EGA's API using the branch's 
#          JSON example files.
# For more information, check:
