# This workflow validates the current JSON documents against EGA's JSON schemas
# using EGA's API endpoint (http://biovalidator.ega.ebi.ac.uk/validate) of
# the tool Biovalidator (https://github.com/elixir-europe/biovalidator) and the
# up-to-date EGA JSON schemas \
# (https://github.com/EbiEga/ega-metadata-schema/tree/main/schemas).
# The logic of this workflow is:
#   - Details: EE-2575
#   - Why: It allows us to know if the changes introduced in the branch are
#          compliant with the default (main branch) schemas and schemas prior
#          any modification in the PR.
#   - Would block the PR if failed? No, it's just a warning.
#   - How: execute script .github/scripts/request_validation.py specifying the
#       EGA's API server endpoint and this new branch's JSON documents.
#
