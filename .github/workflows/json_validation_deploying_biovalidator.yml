# This workflow validates the current JSON documents against EGA's JSON schemas
# using EGA's API endpoint (http://biovalidator.ega.ebi.ac.uk/validate) of
# the tool Biovalidator (https://github.com/elixir-europe/biovalidator) and the
# up-to-date EGA JSON schemas (https://github.com/EbiEga/ega-metadata-schema/tree/main/schemas).
# The logic of this workflow is:
#   - Details: EE-2575
#   - Why: Allows us to check two things:
#       1. Whether the current "main" branch of Biovalidator can be deployed as a server 
#           instance.
#       2. Whether the modified schemas-&-documents (the ones in the branch of the PR)
#            are compliant (i.e. would pass validation) against an up to date 
#            Biovalidator instance.
#   - Would block the PR if failed? Requires interpretation depending on the step
#       at which it failed.
#   - How: (1) Clone current Biovalidator repository; (2) install dependencies 
#       and project; (3) deploy Biovalidator local server, specifying (-r / --ref)
#       the schemas to be used during validation, which would be the ones within
#       the branch; (4) execute script .github/scripts/request_validation.py
#       specifying the localhost server and branch's JSON documents.
